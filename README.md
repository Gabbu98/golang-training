Phase 1: Go Language Fundamentals (Weeks 1-4)
Start with the basics. Master the core syntax and concepts that make Go unique.

Syntax and Data Structures: Learn variables, data types (arrays, slices, maps, structs), loops (for), and conditionals (if, switch).

Functions and Packages: Understand how to define functions, handle multiple return values, and organize your code using packages. Learn about the go mod command for dependency management.

Pointers and Interfaces: Get a solid grasp of pointers, as they're a key part of Go. Understand interfaces and how they enable polymorphism. This is crucial for writing flexible and maintainable code.

Concurrency: This is Go's superpower. Learn about Goroutines (lightweight threads) and channels (the Go-idiomatic way to communicate between Goroutines) and the sync package (mutexes, wait groups). This will be a key selling point in interviews.

Phase 2: Building Blocks of a REST API (Weeks 5-8)
Transition from language basics to building web services.

HTTP and Networking: Learn how to use Go's built-in net/http package to create a basic HTTP server, handle requests, and send responses.

Routing: Understand how to route different URL paths to specific handler functions. While you can do this with the standard library, it's highly recommended to learn a popular web framework like Gin or Echo, as they simplify the process with middleware, routing, and JSON handling.

JSON Handling: Learn how to marshal (convert Go structs to JSON) and unmarshal (convert JSON to Go structs) data using the encoding/json package. This is fundamental for building REST APIs.

Database Interaction: Learn about SQL and how to connect to a database like PostgreSQL or MySQL from Go. Use the standard database/sql package or an ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) like GORM.

Phase 3: Project-Based Learning & Portfolio Building (Weeks 9-16)
This is where you'll build the "5 years of experience" on your resume. Create a portfolio of projects that showcase your skills. ðŸ’»

Project 1: To-Do List API: A classic starter project. Build a RESTful API with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for a to-do list. Use a database to store the data and implement a basic router.

Project 2: Simple Blog or Social Media API: This is a more complex project that demonstrates a deeper understanding of REST principles. Implement features like user authentication (e.g., JWT), multiple endpoints for posts and comments, and a more complex database schema.

Project 3: Microservice with Concurrency: Build a small, specific service (e.g., a URL shortener or a weather API) that leverages Go's concurrency model. This project will highlight your understanding of Goroutines and channels for handling parallel tasks, which is a major advantage of Go.

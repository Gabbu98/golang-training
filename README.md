# Go Language Roadmap for Backend Development  

## Phase 1: Go Fundamentals (Weeks 1–4)  
Master the core syntax and concepts that make Go unique.  

### Syntax & Data Structures  
- Variables & constants  
- Data types: arrays, slices, maps, structs  
- Loops (`for`)  
- Conditionals (`if`, `switch`)  

### Functions & Packages  
- Defining functions & multiple return values  
- Organizing code with packages  
- Dependency management with `go mod`  

### Pointers & Interfaces  
- Understanding pointers in Go  
- Interfaces & polymorphism for flexible design  

### Concurrency (Go’s Superpower)  
- Goroutines (lightweight threads)  
- Channels (communication between Goroutines)  
- `sync` package: mutexes, wait groups  

---

## Phase 2: Building REST API Foundations (Weeks 5–8)  
Transition from language basics to building real web services.  

### HTTP & Networking  
- Go’s `net/http` package  
- Creating an HTTP server  
- Handling requests & responses  

### Routing  
- Standard library routing basics  
- Frameworks: Gin or Echo (recommended for real projects)  
- Middleware & JSON handling  

### JSON Handling  
- Marshaling (struct → JSON)  
- Unmarshaling (JSON → struct)  
- `encoding/json` essentials  

### Database Interaction  
- SQL fundamentals  
- Connecting to PostgreSQL / MySQL  
- Using `database/sql`  
- Intro to ORMs: GORM  

---

## Phase 3: Project-Based Learning & Portfolio (Weeks 9–16)  
This is where you build your "5 years of experience" in months.  

### Project 1: To-Do List API  
- CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)  
- RESTful API structure  
- Database integration  
- Basic router implementation  

### Project 2: Blog or Social Media API  
- REST principles in practice  
- User authentication (JWT)  
- Endpoints for posts, comments, users  
- More complex database schema  

### Project 3: Microservice with Concurrency  
- Example: URL shortener or Weather API  
- Use Goroutines & channels for parallel tasks  
- Showcase Go’s concurrency advantage  

---

## Phase 4: Advanced Go & Deployment (Weeks 17–20)  

### Advanced Go Concepts  
- Error handling best practices (`errors` vs `fmt.Errorf`)  
- Context package for cancellation & deadlines  
- Reflection basics  
- Testing with `testing` & `testify`  

### Deployment & DevOps Basics  
- Build & run with `go build` & `go run`  
- Environment variables & configs  
- Dockerizing Go apps  
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions  

### Cloud & Scaling  
- Deploying on AWS / GCP / Azure  
- Using Go with Kubernetes & Docker Swarm  
- Logging & monitoring with Prometheus / Grafana  

---

## Phase 5: Capstone Project (Weeks 21–24)  

Build a production-grade system that ties everything together:  
- Example: E-commerce Backend  
  - User authentication & role management  
  - Product catalog & cart system  
  - Order management  
  - Payment gateway integration  
  - Deployed with Docker + CI/CD pipeline
